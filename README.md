## How to Create an Inventory

### Create Product Category (this is not required, but definitely recommended.)
      product categories are whatever your logical delineations of product, for example a bar would break up the products int categories like Beer, Wine, Liquor, etc.
      >Important: Pars are integer values only at this time. Also pars should be in the same units that you count in. So, if you count a product by bottle, then your par should be in bottles.
      >Important: Order by is the unit of ordering, so if you order beer by the case, then this is what you enter here. Then you enter the number of bottles in a case in the UnitPack/Size field.
### Create your products
Start creating your products. These are the things that you are going to be counting. This is where you can set your pars, prices, etc.  You will be revisiting this as your prices change.

### Start an inventory
Once you have created your products, you can begin to build an inventory. Go to the inventories page and create an inventory. Just a click. 

This will automatically generate a count sheet from your active inventory.  

### Count your product
You can enter your counts via the edit button.

### Create your orders
Once you have completed your count, you can then the go to the orders area, and generate an order.  Once you create an order, it will automatically generate order items based on your pars.

### Review the order items.You can review the order and adjust order items, remove order items. You can add items to the order that are over par from the count sheet.

Update your order statuses appropriately.  Once you move an order from the 'Generated status" the order totals will now display the orders.

>Gotchas:  You can only have one unfinalized order at a time. IF YOU DELETE AN INVENTORY, it will delete all inventory items. This is true of orders too, deleteing and order will delete all order items related to that order.

>You can only have ONE unfinalized inventory in progress at a time
